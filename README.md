# Message Broker based on Raft Demo

## Introduction
This is an implementation demo of a distributed message broker based on [Raft consensus algorithm](https://raft.github.io/).

This message broker is topic-based and distributed.
A publisher needs to send messages on a topic. A subscriber can subscribe to multiple topics.


## Features

In this demo, the following mechanisms are implemented: leader election, log replication, and dynamic membership.

### Leader Election
- Leader need to send heartbeat to all followers
- Heartbeat message will carry the info about all nodes in the cluster, so that every node have a big picture of the cluster
- All nodes have a random timeout, if they did not receive a heartbeat within that timeout, they become candidates and vote itself
- Candidates send `REQUEST_TO_VOTE` asking others to vote it, every node can only vote once in a given election term
- When the vote exceeds the majority of nodes, the candidate becomes a new leader

### Log Replication
- Un/subscribe will forward to the leader
- Leader will send `append entries` (un/subscribe) to all followers along with heartbeats
- When the majority of followers `ACK`, the leader will append entries locally
- Followers update their local entries when receiving the next heartbeat after `append entries` message.

### Dynamic Membership
#### Join
- When new node want to join, it sends `JOIN_CLUSTER` message to one node in the cluster.
- `JOIN_CLUSTER` is forwarded to the leader, leader will send `SYNC_DATA` to the new node, so new node can get all data (e.g. subscribes)
- After updating the data, new node will send `ACK` to the leader, and start the election timeout mechanism
- Leader will add new node to the cluster info and send to all followers at each heartbeat

#### Leave
- Leader sends heartbeat to followers, when a follower refuses connection or timeout, it means the node leaves the cluster
- Leader will update cluster info and send to all followers at each heartbeat

## Run

### Virtual Environment
```shell
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
