# Message Broker based on Raft Demo

## Introduction
This is an implementation demo of a distributed message broker based on the [Raft consensus algorithm](https://raft.github.io/).

This message broker is topic-based and distributed. Publishers can send messages on a specific topic, while subscribers can subscribe to multiple topics.


## Features

In this demo, the following mechanisms are implemented: leader election, log replication, and dynamic membership.

### Leader Election
- The leader needs to send heartbeats to all followers.
- Heartbeat messages carry information about all nodes in the cluster, allowing each node to have a complete overview of the cluster.
- Each node has a random timeout, and if it does not receive a heartbeat within that timeout, it becomes a candidate and votes for itself.
- Candidates send a `REQUEST_TO_VOTE` message, asking other nodes to vote for them. Each node can only vote once in a given election term.
- the candidate becomes the new leader when it receives the majority of votes.

### Log Replication
- An update request (Subscribe/Unsubscribe) is forwarded to the leader.
- The leader sends `append entries` messages to all followers along with heartbeats.
- When the majority of followers acknowledge (`ACK`) the `append entries` message, the leader appends the entries locally and sends `LEADER_COMMIT` to all followers.
- Followers update their local entries upon receiving `LEADER_COMMIT` from the leader.

### Dynamic Membership
#### Join
- When a new node wants to join, it sends a `JOIN_CLUSTER` message to one node in the cluster.
- The `JOIN_CLUSTER` message is forwarded to the leader. The leader then sends a `SYNC_DATA` message to the new node, allowing the new node to obtain all necessary data (e.g., subscribed topics).
- After updating its data, the new node sends an `ACK` to the leader and starts the election timeout mechanism.
- The leader adds the new node to the cluster information and send the information to all followers with each heartbeat.

#### Leave
- The leader sends heartbeats to followers, and if a follower refuses the connection or timeout, it indicates that the node has left the cluster.
- The leader updates the cluster information and sends it to all followers with each heartbeat.

## Limitations
### Cluster Node Temporarily Unavailable
- If a node is temporarily unavailable and gets kicked from the cluster, there is no mechanism to gracefully re-join the cluster.

### Message Cache Mechanism
- The broker did not implement a message cache mechanism.
- If a subscriber is unavailable when a message is published, the subscriber will lose the message.
- Implementing a message cache mechanism in a cluster is not easy. The challenge lies in notifying all nodes about the cached messages.
  - When a publish message fails to deliver, we need to forward the failed message to the leader and then notify all nodes to update.
  - When a cached message is re-published, we need to delete the cached message and let the leader notify all nodes to update.

### Sharding
- The system did not implement sharding in the cluster.
- Sharding will partition data into groups and each group will only hold some groups instead of all.
- Sharding can alleviate space limitation and make the system more scalable.

### Dedicated Master Node
- The system did not implement dedicated master node.
- In our system, leader will be a bottleneck since it handles not only heartbeats but also requests like publish, subscribe, and unsubscribe.
- A dedicated master node can alleviate this traffic, which only coordinates cluster nodes and does not handle application requests or store data.
- This approach can alleviate the traffic and resolve the leader bottleneck issues.
- However, the dedicated master node will suffer from single-point-of-failure, so we need a cluster for master nodes.
